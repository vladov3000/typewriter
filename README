# Typewriter

A minimal text editor. Supports character input and basic emacs shortcuts:
 - Cmd f: move forward.
 - Cmd b: move backward.
 - Cmd p: move up.
 - Cmd n: move down.
 - Cmd +: zoom in.
 - Cmd -: zoom out.

There is a bug with the subpixel font aliasing that makes the edges of text
rainbow. I am pretty sure I am rendering to the texture at the wrong scale,
but this is tricky to fix because it messes up the math in other areas.
